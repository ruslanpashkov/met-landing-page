Welcome to the MET Landing Page project! This project is a web page designed based on the design in Figma, utilizing HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The page follows a semantic HTML structure, incorporates SCSS as a preprocessor for styling, and implements a JavaScript menu. The project also adheres to the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for better code organization and maintainability.
